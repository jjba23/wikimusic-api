** Releases
*** v0.3.0.0
- Using ~Hasql.Pool~ package across the entire system when doing database queries.
- Implemented the typeclasses for ~Command~ and ~Query~ for the entities ~Artist~ and ~Song~. This means that the Handlers have become lean as f*ck and we have 100% loose coupling between the persistence layer and the domain and handler layers. In principle this is actually a typeclass dependency injection, very elegant.
